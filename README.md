# AngularCore
This is a small business intelligence app that was made using a guide from youtube. The guide was made in Angular 4 and .NET Core 2.1, but this app was made and Angular 8 and .NET Core 2.2, so many things needed to be changed in order for the app to work properly. Despite the changes, I cannot figure out how to get the line chart to work in Angular 8, so that is a work in progress until I learn more about the changes in Angular 8.
