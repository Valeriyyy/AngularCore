# AngularCore
This is a small business intelligence app that was made using a guide from youtube. The guide was made in Angular 4 and .NET Core 2., but this app was made and Angular 8 and .NET Core 2.1, so many things needed to be changed in order for the app to work properly. Everything supposedly works in the browser, but the Angular cli throws an error in the line chart. Overall the app works.
